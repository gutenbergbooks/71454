                                PREFACE


During the past ten years the writer has been trying to find some
consistent and satisfactory working plan for handling the almost
bewildering number of facts, of ecological significance, which have
been accumulating in the literature of zoölogy, biology, and the allied
sciences. This book is the outgrowth of the effort as it has developed
in the study and teaching of animal ecology. I have not attempted
to make this an exhaustive treatment of the subject, but rather to
indicate briefly some of its general bearings and a method of approach.
I have tried to keep in mind the needs of the beginner in ecology.

An ecological point of view is described more fully than the other
subjects discussed, so that the student may see the need of familiarity
with those tests or criteria by means of which he may be able to
determine for himself ecological relations and the validity of
ecological studies. The other phases are treated less fully in the
discussions and with more detail bibliographically so that this may be
a useful source book. The geographical (in the ordinary sense of the
word) aspect has been deliberately omitted. The references should be
looked upon from the standpoint presented in the general portions of
this book, and if the facts and inferences aid in the interpretation of
the relations which exist between animals and the sum total of their
environments, one may fairly consider that they are of ecological worth.

In the arrangement of the references I have tried to group related
papers, but many defy any single system. Some of the publications
deserve to be in several lists, but little duplication has been made,
as this would unduly prolong the lists. The annotations will supplement
the titles and their grouping in indicating the contents and importance
of the papers for our purpose. It has often been difficult to select
from several almost equally valuable and useful papers. Others with
different interests, aims, and experience would doubtless make a
different choice. It will therefore be a favor, if those who use this
handbook and feel that important papers have been excluded, will
communicate this fact to the author.

This book is not intended as a treatise on the science of ecology;
its aim is primarily educational. This is the justification, if any
were necessary, for placing emphasis upon the point of view and the
importance of an understanding of explanatory processes and of the
methods of scientific investigation. Any adequate treatment of this
subject would exceed the space of this volume and it is reserved for
future elaboration.

At present ecology is a science with its facts out of all proportion
to their organization or integration. There is thus an immediate need
of integration, and this above all requires a clear conception of the
scientific method as a tool, and independent thinking as well. The
fact that scientific work progresses more rapidly when consciously
pursued than otherwise should serve as ample justification for this
emphasis.

A word of explanation is desirable to explain certain features of
this volume. It is the outcome of coöperative work on the part of the
Illinois State Laboratory of Natural History and certain members of
the Ecological Survey Committee of the Illinois Academy of Science,
Professors E. N. Transeau and T. L. Hankinson. A local ecological study
was made, as a piece of coöperative work, and directions for study
were to be an introductory section of my part of this report. But as
this part grew on my hands, with the permission of Professor S. A.
Forbes, Director of the Illinois State Laboratory of Natural History, I
decided to publish it separately. This part was written two years and
a half ago, and when separate publication was decided upon, additional
references to the literature were added to bring it to date. These
circumstances explain the emphasis placed upon ecological surveying and
also the brevity of treatment of other aspects.

Further, I am indebted to Professor Forbes for reading the manuscript
and for valuable criticisms, and likewise, for similar assistance, to
my wife, Alice Norton Adams. Skillful help on the proof and index has
been given by Miss Marion E. Sparks.

                    RELATION OF ECOLOGY TO BIOLOGY


“I shall try to show that life is response to the order of nature....
But if it be admitted, it follows that biology is the study of
response, and that the study of that order of nature to which response
is made is as well within its province as the study of the living
organism which responds, for all the knowledge we can get of both these
aspects of nature is needed as a preparation for the study of that
relation between them which constitutes life.”

“To study life we must consider three things:

_first_, the orderly sequence of external nature;

_second_, the living organism and the changes which take place in it;
and,

_third_, that continuous adjustment between the two sets of phenomena
which constitutes life.”

“The physical sciences deal with the external world, and in the
laboratory we study the structure and activities of organisms by very
similar methods; but if we stop there, neglecting the relation of
the living being to its environment, our study is not biology or the
science of life.”

                                                           W. K. BROOKS.




                            ANIMAL ECOLOGY




                  I. AIM, CONTENT, AND POINT OF VIEW


Ecology has no aim, but ecologists have. The problems of the ecologist
are not fundamentally different from those of any other kind of
naturalist. The superficial differences in aim are due to the different
points of view, or methods of approach, rather than to any essential
difference in the character of the problems.

The essentially biological core of ecology may be best shown by
considering the relation which this science bears to other branches of
biology, a relation which has been admirably expressed by the eminent
physiologist, Burdon-Sanderson (’94, pp. 438-439), as follows:

“Now the first thing that strikes us in beginning to think about the
activities of an organism is that they are naturally distinguishable
into two kinds, according as we consider the action of the whole
organism in its relation to the external world or to other organisms,
or the action of the parts or organs in their relation to each other.
The distinction to which we are thus led between the _internal_
and _external_ relation of plants and animals has of course always
existed, but has only lately come into such prominence that it divides
biologists more or less completely into two camps--on the one hand
those who make it their aim to investigate the actions of the organism
and its parts by the accepted methods of physics and chemistry,
carrying this investigation as far as the conditions under which
each process manifests itself will permit; on the other, those who
interest themselves rather in considering the place which each organism
occupies, and the part which it plays in the economy of nature. It is
apparent that the two lines of inquiry, although they equally relate
to what the organism _does_, rather than to what it is, and therefore
both have equal right to be included in the one great science of life,
or biology, yet lead in directions which are scarcely even parallel. So
marked, indeed, is the distinction, that Professor Haeckel some twenty
years ago proposed to separate the study of organisms with reference
to their place in nature under the designation of ‘œcology,’ defining
it as comprising ‘the relations of the animal to its organic as well
as to its inorganic environment, particularly its friendly or hostile
relations to those animals or plants with which it comes into direct
contact.’[1] Whether this term expresses it or not, the distinction is
a fundamental one. Whether with the œcologist we regard the organism in
relation to the world, or with the physiologist as a wonderful complex
of vital energies, the two branches have this in common, that both
studies fix their attention, not on stuffed animals, butterflies in
cases, or even microscopical sections of the animal or plant body--all
of which relate to the framework of life--but on life itself.”

[1] These he identifies with “those complicated mutual relations which
Darwin designates as conditions of the struggle for existence.” Along
with chorology--the distribution of animals--œcology constitutes what
he calls _Relations-physiologie_. Haeckel, “Entwickelungsgang u.
Aufgaben der Zoologie,” Jenaische Zeitschr., 1869, Vol. V, p. 353.

The quotations from Brooks, on a preceding page, show even more
explicitly the intimate relation which exists between biology and
ecology. At first glance they may seem to prove almost too much--that
biology and ecology are synonymous. They show at least that ecology
is concerned with fundamental biological problems--the responses of
organisms to their complete environments.

The relations which different branches of ecology bear to one another
may be discussed under three headings, individual, aggregate, and
associational ecology. These phases are superficially so distinct that
students of one branch may be almost unaware of the existence of the
coördinate branches and may not realize that each is a part of the
larger unit.

_Individual Ecology._--The study of individual ecology is the
investigation of the development (_process_ of formation) of the
structure, function, and behavior of a given individual or kind of
animal from the standpoint of its relations and responses to the
complete environment. All ecologically significant facts should be
considered. Such a study may be devoted to an animal, as, for example,
a bumblebee, a crawfish, or a garter snake, and may be limited to
a single habitat or locality, or extended throughout the entire
geographic range of an animal. From this standpoint the individual
studied becomes the hub of the microcosm, from which all relations and
responses radiate. Most of the physiological studies of ecological
bearing and many investigations of animal behavior have been made from
this viewpoint. The organism is thus considered as an agent which,
transforming and utilizing substance and energy, produces a varied
number of physiological conditions and forms of activity, which in turn
furnish the basis for the constant process of response between the
organism and its environment.

_Aggregate Ecology._--The study of aggregate ecology is the
investigation of the ecological development, relations, and responses
of animals based upon hereditary or taxonomic units, as in a family
community, or in genera, families, orders, etc. These groups or
aggregates are made the basis for the ecologic study, as a hive
of bees, birds, dragon flies (Odonata), the genus _Bombus_. From
this approach the activities and responses of the group are traced
throughout all environments and associations within the area studied,
or throughout the world, and its responses and adjustments to the whole
environment receive primary attention. The hereditary or taxonomic unit
is here the hub of the microcosm. Perhaps most of the contributions to
ecology by the taxonomists are made from this standpoint. Here also the
aggregate is considered as an agent or entity which produces many kinds
of activities and adjustments to the environment.

_Associational Ecology._--Associational ecology is devoted to the
investigation of the development, interrelations, and responses of
animals which are grouped or associated in the same habitats and
environments. In this case the associates in a given association and
habitat are considered as a unit, whose activities and interrelations
and responses are investigated in the same manner as if it were a
single animal. The interactions among members of an association are to
be compared to the similar relations existing between the different
cells, organs, or activities of a single individual. Such groupings
have a composition which has developed into an arrangement, or
“spacing,” of individuals within it, and which produces a particular
plan or pattern, as a result of the innumerable responsive activities
on the part of the individuals which live together. For example, when
the animals living in a small brook, the littoral zone of a lake, in a
colony of breeding gulls, or on the floor of a forest, are treated as a
unit, the entire history of the animals in the habitat is considered as
a response to the conditions of life.

In this form of study the association becomes the center of all
radiating relations and responses. Such an association is an agent
which transforms substance and energy, producing varied physiological
conditions and responses in the continuous process of adjustment “which
constitutes life.” The physiological needs and states of an association
have as real existence in individual animals as have similar needs in
the cell or cells which compose the animal body. The mere statement of
the facts of such relations is enough to make valid such a comparison.

For the associational aspect of ecology the German naturalist, Möbius,
proposed in 1877 the term “biocœnosis.” The meaning of this he
expressed very clearly and concisely, and on account of its relatively
obscure publication, in a paper devoted to oyster culture, it has not
gained the circulation among zoölogists which its importance merits.
His statement (Möbius, ’83, p. 723) is as follows:

“Every oyster-bed is thus, to a certain degree, a community of living
beings, a collection of species, and a massing of individuals, which
find here everything necessary for their growth and continuance, such
as suitable soil, sufficient food, the requisite percentage of salt,
and a temperature favorable to their development. Each species which
lives here is represented by the greatest number of individuals which
can grow to maturity subject to the conditions which surround them, for
among all species the number of individuals which arrive at maturity
at each breeding period is much smaller than the number of germs
produced at that time. The total number of mature individuals of all
the species living together in any region is the sum of the survivors
of all the germs which have been produced at all past breeding or brood
periods; and this sum of matured germs represents a certain quantum of
life which enters into a certain number of individuals, and which,
as does all life, gains permanence by means of transmission. Science
possesses, as yet, no word by which such a community of living beings
may be designated; no word for a community where the sum of species and
individuals, beings mutually limited and selected under the average
external conditions of life, have, by means of transmission, continued
in possession of a certain definite territory. I propose the word
_Biocænosis_[2] for such a community. Any change in any of the relative
factors of a biocönose produces changes in other factors of the same.
If, at any time, one of the external conditions of life should deviate
for a long time from its ordinary mean, the entire biocönose, or
community, would be transformed. It would also be transformed, if the
number of individuals of a particular species increased or diminished
through the instrumentality of man, or if one species entirely
disappeared from, or a new species entered into, the community.” (See
Figure 1).

The three methods of approach to ecological study are not so distinct
as they appear at first thought. With perfecting knowledge the network
of interrelations increases and the paths converge. Then also the study
of the individual behavior of “social” animals, as ants, white ants,
bees, or birds which live and breed in colonies, shows transitional
stages from the individual unit to that of the family, the colony, and
on to the association. Yet the advantage of each point of view should
be recognized as an aid in the analysis and synthesis of any problem.

Some students feel that the study of individual ecology should precede
that of the associational. Within certain limits this is true, but
if our general knowledge of biology had waited for the perfection of
our knowledge of the individual cells of animals, the results would
have been disastrous to all concerned. Even now our knowledge of these
subjects is very incomplete. For similar reasons there should be no
delay in studying animal aggregates and associations.

A combination of ecological and taxonomic study generally appeals most
strongly to those students who have made a specialty of some group of
animals. They are familiar with certain forms, have some confidence
in taxonomic methods, and frequently have given some attention to
habits, life histories, and to collecting. To those who like the
descriptive aspect of taxonomy, ecological studies also offer a new
field for further description and classification. At present perhaps
the majority of ecological students have entered the subject through
taxonomy. It is the almost universal verdict of such students that it
has required much effort on their part to make the change in the point
of view. Such a change cannot be made by a simple resolve, but requires
a modification of the habits of the mind, which will be attended by a
distinct consciousness of effort. As in other habits, reversion to the
older attitude of mind is very easy. This change in point of view is
a problem in habit formation, a study of the mental behavior of the
ecologist, which is in reality the main topic thus far discussed.
One may attempt to make such a change and find that he does not have
sufficient modifiability to make it permanent, so that it is only for
the moment, during actual collision with some stubborn fact, that he is
able to realize ecological relations and an ecological point of view.

To the physiologist, however, individual ecology tends to appeal
most strongly, and he, perhaps on account of the preponderance of
analytical methods in his work, feels that this is the safest and most
important aspect. This statement is perhaps also true of most students
of animal behavior. This is largely due to the great present need of
analytical methods in these lines, and perhaps indicates a stage in
the development of their science rather than a permanent condition.
Later a synthetic development will probably become more prominent, and
with it will come a change in estimating relative values. Generally
physiologists allow for a greater influence of the environment than
do many other students. They are impressed with the dependence of
organisms upon their environment, and the study of their reactions only
reinforces this conception.

The ecologist who studies the responses of animals cannot help being
impressed with the processes of adjustment, and with adaptation as a
_process_. It is adaptation as a process, rather than as a product,
which perhaps interests him most, and emphasis needs to be placed
upon this distinction. The problem of adaptation as a process may be
a different and separate one from that of evolution, but individual
animals must have shown adjustive adaptation, or there could have been
no perpetuation to continue the struggle of adjustment. Ecological
problems are likely to raise a question as to the relative importance
of adaptation and evolution--if they are separate problems. The present
generation has perhaps been more deeply impressed by evolution as a
process, than by adaptation as a process.

The ecology of living animals is only the latest chapter in the volume
on this subject; the preceding chapters will contain a history of the
indefinitely long series of ecological responses which have taken place
in the geologic past. Here is where the ecologist and paleontologist
and geologist find common ground. The ecology of living animals must
furnish us with whatever firm basis we have for the interpretation of
the conditions of life in the past, upon which the paleontologist,
stratigrapher, or paleogeographer must depend, at least in part, for
his interpretations.

With still another training and interest, as in the case of those
especially interested in human affairs, such as the sociologist,
the physician, the sanitary expert, and the agriculturist, we may
ultimately expect a greater appreciation for the associational aspect
because of the social or associational character of human society.
The associational is the phase of animal activity which may be
considered as the form of animal behavior which has developed into the
human social relations. It is a response to the complete organic and
inorganic environment.

It is rather natural that in a relatively newly recognized subject
like ecology this human aspect has not been very fully discussed.
For practical reasons the ecology of man has been developed largely
independent of that of animals; just as human physiology and psychology
have been developed relatively independent of comparative or general
physiological psychology. To the mutual advantage of these subjects
they are now rapidly converging, and we may anticipate a similar
relation between general animal ecology and the ecology of man. In
a general treatise on animal ecology the human phase should not
receive undue emphasis any more than it should in a general physiology
of animals or in a comparative psychology. But, nevertheless, the
relationships of man and his animal associates (slaves, domestic
animals, rats, mice, parasites, etc.) form as truly an animal
association as do those of the animals which live associated in some
forest glade; and in all probability, before any approximately complete
understanding can be had of the human associations, their roots and
principles of activity must be known and understood in the less
aristocratic portion of his animal relatives.

The recognition of the associational aspect of ecology, as well as that
human ecology is a part of general animal ecology, is of recent origin.
This is very well shown in the following quotation from Huxley (1854.
On the Educational Value of the Natural History Sciences):

“Biology deals only with living beings as isolated things--treats
only of the life of the individual: but there is a higher division
of science still, which considers living beings as aggregates--which
deals with the relation of living beings one to another--the science
which _observes_ men--whose _experiments_ are made by nations one upon
another, in battlefields--whose _general propositions_ are embodied
in history, morality, and religion--whose _deductions_ lead to our
happiness or our misery--and whose _verifications_ so often come too
late, and serve only

    ‘To point a moral, or adorn a tale’--

I mean the science of Society or _Sociology_.”

At a later date (1876. On the Study of Biology) Huxley says: “For
whatever view we may entertain about the nature of man, one thing
is perfectly certain, that he is a living creature. Hence, if our
definition is to be interpreted strictly, we must include man and
all his ways and works under the head of Biology; in which case, we
should find that psychology, politics, and political economy would
be absorbed into the province of Biology. In strict logic no one can
object to this course.... The real fact is that we biologists are a
self-sacrificing people ... [so that] we feel that we have more than
sufficient territory.... But I should like you to recollect that that
is a sacrifice, and that you should not be surprised if it occasionally
happens that you see a biologist apparently trespassing in the region
of philosophy or politics; or meddling with human education; because,
after all, that is a part of his kingdom which he has only voluntarily
forsaken.”

Whether sociology is regarded as a response of man to his fellows or
to the whole of his environment is inconsequential in its bearing upon
whether or not it is ecological. The response of man, as an animal,
to a part or the whole of his environment is strictly ecological.
Huxley recognized one relation very clearly, and that is that the
ecological relations of _individuals_ do not currently include the
higher synthesis which deals with them as associations, or “aggregates”
as he terms them. So far as known to the writer, human activities in
general have never been fully and comprehensively oriented from the
ecological standpoint, even by the humanitarians themselves, although
some important preliminary steps have been taken. It looks as if such a
viewpoint might give a new unity to all studies of human relations.

There is still another class of persons, particularly teachers and
isolated students, who desire first of all to understand and interpret
their own vicinity, and who will inquire which of the three plans their
work best fits. If such a one begins with the detailed study of each
species, the general survey will not be completed during his lifetime.
If he uses the larger taxonomic units, he may survey the field by going
over the same ground again and again, with each of the different groups
successively in mind, until the entire field has been surveyed. Or,
lastly, he may divide the area into associations and study the animals
which are found living together, and by studying one association
after another he may cover the entire field. A teacher will find
certain important advantages in this plan, and certain disadvantages.
One of the most important considerations in its favor is that such a
study results in a familiarity with the kinds of animals one actually
finds in natural groups, as when his class is on an excursion. The
natural history which a farmer, a fisherman, a summer vacationist,
or a sportsman acquires is grouped in this same manner. Thus to a
large number of people this is the natural method of approach, and is
generally of most permanent value, except possibly to some professional
teachers or zoölogists. One of its greatest disadvantages is that in
most of the literature which one must use, the animals are not grouped
in this way, but taxinomically.

The individual, aggregate, and associational methods of study are in
themselves subject to diverse angles of approach, and each has its
particular advantages and disadvantages. Of the methods of approach
mention will be made of three only, the descriptive, the comparative,
and the genetic or method of processes. The descriptive method must
develop to some degree before the genetic problems can be adequately
stated, and the mature development of the genetic may, and generally
does, lag far behind that of the descriptive. The reason for this
is simple, for it is evident that it is much easier to describe
what we see than it is to explain how it originated or its process
of development. At present biology as a science is mainly in the
descriptive stage, though it is slowly but surely becoming explanatory
and genetic. The developmental or explanatory method is so difficult
that every possible expedient--observation, comparison, reflection,
experiment, etc.--must be used to secure the proper development of the
main phases of ecology. There is a marked tendency in the naturalist
to master one system of work, as observation or experiment, and to use
it as a tool almost exclusively, turning from one phase of the subject
to another, and continuing the use of the same method. This way of
working is favorable to a good technique, but its weakness is that it
often tends to give its user a feeling of the great superiority and
reliability of the result reached by his method, and a correspondingly
less appreciative recognition of results secured by other methods.
To observe, to experiment, to reflect, to dissect, to stain, and to
collect are only partial methods of investigation, and this fact should
be realized and be kept in mind when estimating values and planning
work.

The aim of the ecologist is professedly genetic or explanatory because
it is the study of _responses_ to all conditions of the complete
environment. But these responses must be described, and the conditions
influencing them as well, so that a descriptive aspect is an essential
part in all phases of ecology. In the study of the responses of an
individual, an order, or an association, pure description of the
responses is necessary; but a description which will at once describe
and show the working of the processes by which the results were
produced, is of quite a different order. This phase of explanation
has been most concisely expressed and applied by the students of the
physical sciences, and biologists may profit much from a study of their
methods.

When, however, we turn to the viewpoint of the development of the
science of ecology as a whole, a symmetrical development of the subject
is most desirable. The preponderating influence of any special point
of view tends, like dominance in general, to smother or suppress other
germinating and competing ideas. The different special interests each
have their advantages and disadvantages, as does a general interest.
Diversity in students leads to diversity in the development of the
subject, and a variety of emotional appeals to the student has its
advantages. And just as the special student should devote some
attention to the general bearing of his work, so also should the
student of the general aspects cultivate some special field of interest.

The preceding discussion of the aims and methods in ecological study
has been intended to indicate some of its general bearings, and to give
the student some idea of the tests or criteria which may be used to aid
in steering his course through the maze of observations which he may
make and the opinions which he encounters. It is of equal importance
for the student to be able to perceive ecological relations as recorded
by others, because one person’s experience is so limited compared
with the general body of recorded fact and inference. Furthermore,
there are also so many degrees and kinds of work that go by the name
ecological, which may or may not be, and so many also which are truly
ecological but which do not pass under that name, that it is necessary
that the student shall be able to see through its diverse guises and
recognize its essential character. Whenever the question arises as
to the ecological character of a fact, inference, or conclusion, its
ecological validity may be tested in the following way:

Do the facts, inferences, or conclusions show a _response_ to the
inorganic or organic environment:

1. As an individual of a species or kind of animal?

2. As a group of taxonomically related animals?

3. As an association of interacting animals?

Not seen by writer. Dr. W. M. Wheeler, of Harvard University, has
kindly sent me the following note from p. 285. “‘It is to ethology
therefore that the fourth part of this work is devoted, to which
belongs the study of the relations of organisms within the family and
the society in the aggregate and in the community.’ In a volume of
the same work, page xx, St. Hilaire gives his program and speaks of
the general facts belonging to ethological laws. These are defined as
‘relating to the instincts, habits and more generally to the external
vital manifestations of organisms.’” About the preceding Dr. Wheeler
remarks: “You see this covers precisely the field which was a few years
later called ‘ecology’ by Haeckel. Apparently the part of the work in
which St. Hilaire wished to give a detailed account of the ethological
phenomena of animals was not published. Only three volumes of the work
exist. He died November 10, 1861, without having completed the work.”

Thus ethology has priority over ecology, but to my mind this fact
carries no special weight, particularly since the word has become
current in botany. To use a different name for the same subject or
process in botany and zoölogy is as undesirable as to use a different
term for heredity in plants and in animals.

LANKESTER, E. R.

1889. Article “Zoölogy.” Ency. Britannica, 9th ed. Amer. Reprint. Vol.
XXIV, pp. 842, 856.

Lankester defines “Bionomics.--The lore of the farmer, gardener,
sportsman, fancier, and field naturalist, including thremmatology,
or the science of breeding, and the allied teleology, or science of
organic adaptations: exemplified by the patriarch Jacob, the poet
Vergil, Sprengel, Kirby and Spence, Wallace, and Darwin.... Buffon
(1707-1788) alone among the greater writers of the three past centuries
emphasized that view of living things which we call ‘bionomics.’
Buffon deliberately opposed himself to the mere exposition of the
structural resemblances and differences of animals, and, disregarding
classification, devoted his treatise on natural history to a
consideration of the habits of animals and their adaptations to their
surroundings, whilst a special volume was devoted by him to the subject
of reproduction.... Buffon is the only prominent writer who can be
accorded historic rank in this study.”

As I have access to but few of Buffon’s writings, I quote the above.
Bionomics is seen not to be synonymous with ecology, as defined by most
students, although it includes much that is ecological. The chaotic and
unorganized “lore of the farmer” has no unifying or guiding principles,
and although it contains many facts, from which a science may be built,
to call it science seems undesirable.

It is of course advantageous in some ways to have agreement as to
the limitations of ecology, or any science, but even the more exact
sciences seem to fare little better, as is shown by the following
statement: “It is not long since I heard a university professor begin
a lecture on physics somewhat in this way: ‘Physics is the science
of matter and energy. This field is so large that it is customary at
present to break off the physics of the molecule and its reactions and
call it chemistry. Also to put to one side the physics of the heavenly
bodies and call this a part of astronomy,’ etc.” (Strong, Science, N.

            II. THE VALUE AND METHOD OF ECOLOGICAL SURVEYS

“I cannot too strongly emphasize the fact ... that a comprehensive
survey of our entire natural history is absolutely essential to a good
_working knowledge_ of those parts of it which chiefly attract popular
attention,--that is, its edible fishes, its injurious and beneficial
insects, and its parasitic plants. Such a survey, however, should not
stop with a study of the dead forms of nature, ending in mere lists and
descriptions. To have an _applicable_ value, it must treat the life of
the region as an organic unit, must study it _in action_, and direct
principal attention to the laws of its activity.”--S. A. FORBES. 1883.


Natural history surveys have come down to us from the early days of
zoölogy. These surveys have been of many kinds and have ranged from
the adventurous accounts of early and daring explorers to those of
such naturalists as Belt, Bates, Wallace, and Darwin, onward to the
voluminous accounts of the “Biologia Centrali-Americana,” and in the
_Challenger_ reports. These surveys have contributed greatly to our
knowledge of the fundamental facts of zoölogy and to the training of
naturalists.

The most frequent form of survey is that carried on along the lines
which most nearly approach individual and aggregate ecology. Most of
such surveys give only slight attention to the _responsive relation_,
or only to its most general aspects. Surveys of the usual character
are of great importance, and with students of taxonomic training and
interests only, this form of survey occurs very naturally. Most of the
governmental and state surveys and museum expeditions are developed
along these lines. The frequency with which such methods are used in
surveys, which are expected to produce economic results, indicates
that these methods are generally considered the most satisfactory. The
exceptions to this rule are mainly surveys of fresh and salt waters,
and are related in some way to aquatic resources. Except when detailed
individual studies of certain species or some special subject has been
made, the usual form of the reports of such surveys is the annotated
list. It is rarely that even brief chapters discuss the groupings of
the animals as they are found associated in nature. These statements
show that, judging from the past, the methods currently used cannot
be depended upon for a rapid and symmetrical development of ecology,
or for the best development of ecological surveys. These must be
developed in a more direct and deliberate manner, by carefully planned
and executed ecological investigations. It is desirable also that
ecological surveys should be conducted along some one of the three main
avenues of approach, individual, aggregate, and associational, in order
that the science may develop symmetrically. The following are some of
the reasons which may be mentioned in favor of such surveys:

As a record of the associations, their interrelations and responses
to their environment--before they have become too much changed or
exterminated. This is a duty to future naturalists and to future
science. The animal remains in themselves are only a very incomplete
record; their activities and environments are an essential part of the
animals and should also be preserved.

The study of original conditions is a simpler problem than after
interference by man, but excessive modifications result in the
simplicity due to annihilation and a corresponding imperfection of
knowledge. The value of a knowledge of original conditions tends to
increase with time, and will aid much in future interpretations when
there is still more disturbance. Thus an important perspective may be
developed which will aid in estimating relative values. At the present
time the loss of records of original conditions is only beginning to
be felt. The possibility of making certain records will vanish with
each generation. It is not even desirable to _preserve all_, but it is
evident that many ecological records should be preserved.

As the importance of ecological studies, in natural environments,
comes to be more generally recognized the serious encroachments of
civilization upon habitats and associations is enforced upon us. Not
only are the descriptions of these associations very few in number, but
the interrelations of the animals in them are even less known, and the
chances of preserving adequate records before their complete extinction
are becoming fewer every year. Without the least disparagement of
other lines of work, one can but wonder if the naturalists of the
future will commend our foresight in studying with such great diligence
certain aspects of biology which might be very well delayed, while
ephemeral and vanishing records are allowed to be obliterated without
the least concern. These changes are generally greatest where civilized
man is most dominant, and in progressive attenuations, zones, or
strips, the degree of change produced by him radiates. Ecology has
developed only at a late stage in civilization, after much of the
environment has undergone great changes, so that in order to study
the original conditions, which are of such great historic and genetic
significance, he must make long journeys, or invade the swamps or
sterile uplands which man has not yet been able to reduce to the
average conditions best suited to his needs. This state of affairs
is one which, at times, makes him thankful that there are conditions
which, for the present at least, man cannot cultivate and utterly
change and mutilate. Some appear to think that an interest in such
original conditions is of no particular scientific value, or is largely
one of sentiment; still others, that such studies have no practical
value. But if we come to consider that the original primeval conditions
give us our best conception of the _normal processes of nature_ and are
comparable to the normal health of an organism, it puts the subject
in another light. A pathological condition is, of course, a state in
a natural process, as is also any disturbance of the normal order
of nature by man, and each should be studied scientifically. But the
science of pathology has developed best as a study of the disturbances
of normal processes and is interpreted primarily in terms of the
normal; and the artificial should be similarly interpreted--the natural
being the basis to which all standards must be referred. A comparison
may also profitably be made between natural conditions and the
physiological and vital optima of organisms and to the responses which
are made with departures from such conditions. Similar comparisons
should be made in the study of the responses of aggregations and
associations in natural environments and departures from them. No
matter how much we learn, the normal must remain as the ideal, and all
departures from and disturbances of such conditions must be interpreted
in terms of this fundamental unit.

To study disturbed, artificial, and “pathological” conditions, without
an adequate knowledge of the normal and original conditions of both
the organisms and the environment, is an attempt to interpret the
abnormal and artificial in terms of itself, rather than in terms of
the normal. If, however, the normal is no longer preserved, then its
nearest approach should be studied, but with all the more care and
caution. With a proper understanding of the normal, the disturbances
made by man will be capable of _interpretation in an orderly sequence
strictly comparable to that found in the original and natural
conditions_. The cutting down and washing of the lands, the draining
and filling of depressions, the flooding of the lands, the destruction
(or succession) of plant and animal associations (including crop
rotation), are processes brought about or practiced by other organisms
or animal agencies. An ecological standpoint gives us a consistent,
comprehensive orientation of all these natural and “artificial”
activities and processes, and shows the unity in all organic responses
to the environment. Man’s influence in the main consists of hastening
or retarding “natural processes.”

Naturalists have for a long time spoken of the “balance of nature”
and of the all-pervading influence of any serious disturbance of
it. This balance is, of course, only a relative condition, and not
absolutely fixed. It swings from one side, then back, sometimes
showing considerable amplitude in its swing, then again its moves are
very slight, mere tremblings, as it were. But now and then some local
catastrophic event occurs which overturns everything, as when a volcano
becomes active, or some dominant association takes possession of the
field,--as in the case of man,--and a new order is initiated and a new
balance is developed. The mongoose in Jamaica, our English sparrow, and
rabbits in Australia are the classic examples of the overturning of the
local order of nature by the agency of other organisms. Obviously this
balance is not a condition limited to any particular locality or group
of organisms. Balance is very generally conceded to be of fundamental
importance in the study of any species or group of organisms, if its
place in the economy of nature is understood. A vast number of the
problems of the economic zoölogist are thus problems, not so much of
individual or aggregate ecology, but ones in which the balance of the
whole local biotic _association_ is concerned.

This was the fact pointed out by Möbius when he studied the oyster and
came to see that it must be studied not in isolation but as a member
of a community, association of animals, or a biocœnosis, as he called
these interrelated organisms. These facts are mentioned, as examples
from a vast number that are recorded, to show that our applied or
economic zoölogy and entomology are _fundamentally more closely related
to associational ecology_ than to any other phase of zoölogy, and to
suggest that it would be to the great advantage of the students of such
problems if they clearly understood this relation. This is also an
argument for the ecological organization of a vast number of natural
history surveys, because the associational grouping of observations and
responses gives the most intimate knowledge of the life of animals in
the network of their environmental relations.

In addition to the balance of nature which is found within the
small associational units there are the larger ones of considerable
geographic extent, which the students of faunal or floral problems
frequently call zones or distinct regions. Some of these are distinct
ecological units, whose _dynamic status_ should be determined, so that
we may know and understand whether it is in a condition of stress,
a process of adjustment, or one of relative equilibrium or balance.
Under present conditions in what direction does it tend to move? At
what rate? The non-ecological surveys have not put these questions
or worked deliberately toward a goal which will answer them. For any
comprehensive study of this character we need to have determined what
may be considered as a _biotic base_, optimum, or balance, toward which
relations under given conditions tend, and at which an equilibrium
will become established (The Auk, 1908, Vol. XXV, p. 125). Such facts
underlie all of the problems involved in the interpretation of climax
biotic associations, and their application by man. Cook (1909, Bull.
145, Bur. Plant Industry, U. S. Dept. Agriculture, pp. 7, 8) has
expressed similar relations as follows: “Unless we can form a definite
idea of the original conditions we cannot expect to judge of their
influence on primitive man, nor can we determine what effects man has
had upon the vegetation and other natural conditions. We need what
might be called a bionomic base line, an idea of the conditions which
existed before man came upon the scene, the conditions which would
again supervene if the human inhabitants were withdrawn.”

It is perhaps significant that the genetic or successional relations
of habitats and associations, as contrasted with their descriptive
classification, both in plants and animals, have in the past been
developed, not by the ecological students who live and work among
conditions greatly modified by man, as in parts of Europe, but in the
newer, less modified America. In this respect a parallel exists to the
development of our knowledge and the process and genetic interpretation
of topography, which has also developed more rapidly in America than
elsewhere. The process and genetic method which has developed in
this physical science has now spread to the biological sciences and
has found a fertile soil there for development on account of the
_relatively_ undisturbed biotic conditions which still persist in
certain areas.

In this connection it may be worth while to indicate some of the
ecological disadvantages under which the non-ecological surveys are
carried on. As a rule, such surveys feel no strong obligation to
record fully the conditions of the environment, or its developmental
processes. The environment is considered as static, and not as a
changing medium; it has no past or future, it has merely horizontal
extension. The problem as to its _dynamic status_, whether in a
condition of stress, in the process of adjustment, or in relative
equilibrium, is not raised, or if it should be, it could not be
handled. The student eager for new and little-known species is not the
one to study such relations, at least, as a rule, this has not been his
practice. So long as the success of a day’s work is measured by the
length of the list of novelties secured, rather than by the quality and
quantity of ecological relations discovered, such students and surveys
will not contribute greatly to our knowledge of the economy of nature
in the regions surveyed.

At the present time it is very difficult to secure trained men to do
ecological surveying. Even a superficial examination of this paper
should show that familiarity with ecologic methods and results is not
one to be acquired offhand, but a knowledge which requires considerable
special training; not only as much as is usually required for other
kinds of zoölogical work, but generally more, because of its synthetic
relational tendency which requires a broad knowledge as well as some
special knowledge in several lines of biology and the allied sciences.
Conventionally considered, a properly equipped physiologist must have
a working knowledge of certain phases of modern physics and chemistry
in addition to his grounding in biology. A properly trained anatomist
should have a knowledge of physiological and developmental processes,
or his anatomy is purely descriptive and static. A student of general
zoölogy should be grounded not only in physiological and developmental
processes, but also in the relations of the organisms to their
complete environment. The ecologist requires also the grounding in
physiological, developmental, and ecological processes of adjustment,
but as well he must understand the processes by which the vegetation
and the physical environment have been and are being developed and
their method of mutual interrelations and adjustment. It is difficult
for some students to develop the ecological phases in the field. There
are many disadvantages to be overcome. The difficulties are similar,
in some respects, to those of the ethnologist who is sent on some
museum expedition. The wealthy donor of the funds may wish to see a
room filled with specimens on the return of the ethnologist, so that
materials which have bulk and make a showing take precedence over
detailed studies of the habits, traditions, languages, and descriptions
of the people, because such studies require appreciation rather than
inspection for evaluation. The zoölogical student may meet with just
the same kind of difficulty. His institutional authorities often judge
values by the cubic foot and pound, rather than by the quality of
relations discovered. The student himself who has had an extensive
collecting experience, in which quantity and variety have been the
ideal, finds it difficult to return from a day’s work with only a few
pages of notes on the responses of the animals, and with perhaps only a
few specimens.

With such an understanding of the general rules of the game we may
turn to the application or art of ecology, to indicate its relation
to general problems. With a grounding in the general principles of
organic response to the total environment, one is able to see that
the disturbances due to man are a problem in the adjustment of the
highest type of animal, as a member of an animal association, to its
complete environment. The “control of nature” for which men strive is
the process of making the environments and associations _to order_. The
disturbances in the natural order may be looked upon as so many huge
experiments or trial activities in this process of adjustment.

If natural preserves are not made, how will the next generation be best
grounded in the general principles of the science? Are these complex
modified conditions the natural place to start the student, or should
such problems be reserved for the maturely trained one? These disturbed
fragmentary conditions may be likened to fragmentary fossils whose
interpretation is attempted. A paleontologist whose only knowledge
of animals was derived from such fragments, and who had never known
a perfect living animal, would certainly be at a great disadvantage
in such an investigation. The natural starting point therefore seems
to be in as nearly natural normal environments and associations as is
possible, and with such experience one is prepared for the more complex
problems resulting from man’s activity.

By way of conclusion, some of the main advantages of ecological surveys
are:

1. The _record_ of natural environments and their associations for
future generations.

2. The study of natural biotic conditions giving a _perspective_ not
derived in any other way.

3. The clearer conception of the _dynamic relations_ of the balance of
nature, biotic base, and climax associations.

4. Emphasis of the _process and interpretative_ phase of scientific
investigation over that of purely descriptive study.

5. Facilitating the invention of multiple working hypotheses which bear
upon animal responses in nature.

6. Furnishing important conceptions to the study of the _processes_ of
adaptation and the struggle for existence.

7. Furnishing important general principles of great value in applied
ecology.

8. Furnishing one of the best methods of learning how to get acquainted
with the _living aspect_ of the animals of any region.




                           III. FIELD STUDY

“Is not the biological laboratory which leaves out the ocean and the
mountains and meadows a monstrous absurdity? Was not the greatest
scientific generalization of your times reached independently by two
men who were eminent in their familiarity with living things in their
homes?”--BROOKS, 1899, p. 41.


In taking up field work, or any other kind of complex study, a definite
working plan is of much value. For this reason this subject deserves
more than a mere mention. Such a plan greatly aids in keeping in mind
the general aim of the study, and particularly the lesser aims which
develop with the analysis of the subject. It further aids in the proper
orientation and subordination of allied subjects which crowd in from
all directions.

For many students it is a good plan to make out a general outline of
any proposed study as soon as possible after the work has been started.
In the beginning it is difficult to realize the radiating relations
of a subject, and the attempt at such plans aids in the perception of
these relationships and becomes an important guide. Such an outline
will need several revisions, but these changes will come with a
broadening and deepening grasp of the subject. Perhaps the greatest
value of such a plan is that it facilitates the conscious effort to
seek a definite goal by maintaining a standard of measurement.

In addition to a comprehensive analytical plan others are useful.
Particularly is this true when several lines of work are being done
simultaneously or when the work must be interrupted frequently.
Under such circumstances even a daily program may aid in utilizing
many of the fragments of time which are so easily lost. In this way
incomplete observations, verifications, and similar small items which
are time-consuming may be made. These plans apply with particular force
to field study when several lines of observation are being driven
abreast. I have found it profitable to keep memoranda on note slips
which will recall items needing further attention, at certain places
in the field or on certain subjects. Thus, for example, if plans are
suddenly changed and another locality is visited, the proper note slips
indicating the points for special study at such a place are quickly
secured, and one can hasten to the field prepared for the work of the
day. Of course, similar plans are applicable to many kinds of work.

To learn how to study in the field, and not simply to collect, is one
of the most important habits which a field naturalist and the ecologist
has to acquire. This is one which he must, to a large degree, master
alone, without the ready access to assistance, as is usually the
case in the laboratory study. It is also a subject about which it is
difficult to give useful suggestions, other than those of the most
general nature. Directions for collecting are, on the other hand,
simpler and more accessible in the form of numerous manuals filled with
practical suggestions.

Field study is not confined to observations alone, but to the securing
of all kinds of evidence from the field which will aid in the
interpretation of the field relations of animals. Thorough intimacy
with the animals can only be acquired through repeated and prolonged
excursions in the field. This may mean excursions at any hour of the
day or night. Part of this familiarity is best acquired by an intensive
study of some limited area or association, and by thus establishing a
unit for comparison so that the differences in other places are more
readily perceived and described.

Before selecting a limited area for study one should make a general
examination of a much larger tract, so that one may be sure that the
area selected is a fair sample and worthy of the special study. There
are also many advantages in selecting areas little modified by man.
Such modified areas may, to better advantage, be considered later;
just as pathology should be studied after one is grounded in normal
histology. Undoubtedly the normal, or its approximation, is the best
foundation upon which to build, and here we have the educational
argument for natural preserves for animals and their superiority over
highly modified “parks” for the same purpose.

Having selected a locality, repeated and prolonged visits, careful
observation, and description of the place and animals will enable one
to acquire the desired familiarity. For the study of the behavior of
the animals concerned many observations can be made by remaining quiet,
carefully concealed, and recording all observations. This method is
particularly applicable to animals which live in exposed places, such
as many insects, birds, and mammals. For other kinds, only indirect
methods of observation are possible, or only when under controlled
conditions. For the indirect methods of observation many forms of
traps have been devised, traps not intended merely to receive the
dead animal, but those also which will secure the animal and reveal
something of its behavior. For the study of the habits and behavior of
such animals as live in the soil or under bark, etc., both extensive
collecting and examination of the animals in vivaria will also be
necessary.

Fortunately for the student of mammals, birds, and fishes we have
excellent guides for the technique of study and photographing of
individual and associated kinds in the works of Kearton (1907), Chapman
(1900), Herrick (1905), and Reighard (1908). It is very desirable that
these methods be applied to the interrelations among the animals of an
association. The student of behavior in nature has much to learn from
many excellent studies of animal behavior which have been carried on in
recent years by laboratory students. Fortunately the line between these
two methods of study is breaking down to the mutual advantage of each.
The border line between these two methods will give excellent returns
to any student well prepared in each line of work.

Another essential for good field work is a clear understanding of what
ecological studies attempt to do. This implies some general conception
of what is worth while ecologically; it assumes a point of view or
other criterion which may be applied to test the trueness of one’s
aim. The ecologist will meet with much more than ecological facts, but
it is to these that he should give primary attention. These accessory
facts, no matter how interesting in themselves, should not divert
him from the main course. The ecologist must select from this mass
of experience those facts, inferences, and conclusions which help in
the _interpretation_ of the responses of animals to their complete
environment. It is thus evident why the ecologist must have a clearly
defined aim, with criteria for estimating values, or he will be at
the risk of dissipating his energies. This phase of our problem as
applied to the studies of a geologist, but applying with equal force
to the ecologist, has been concisely expressed by Van Hise (1904, pp.
611-612) as follows: “I have heard a man say: ‘I observe the facts
as I find them, unprejudiced by any theory.’ I regard this statement
as not only condemning the work of the man, but the position is an
impossible one. No man has ever stated more than a small part of the
facts with reference to any area. The geologist must select the facts
which he regards of sufficient note to record and describe. But such
selection implies theories of their importance and significance. In a
given case the problem is therefore reduced to selecting the facts for
record, with a broad and deep comprehension of the principles involved,
a definite understanding of the rules of the game, an appreciation of
what is probable and what is not probable; or else making mere random
observations. All agree that the latter alternative is worse than
useless, and therefore the only training which can make a geologist
safe, even in his observations, is to equip him with such a knowledge
of the principles concerned as will make his observations of value.”

Early in field work one should learn that the collection of specimens
is not the primary aim of excursions, that specimens are only
_one_ kind of facts, but that field study should be devoted to
the accumulation of specimens, and to observations on the habits,
activities, interrelations, and responses of animals, as well as to all
facts, inferences, and suggestions which are likely to be of use in the
interpretation of the problems studied.

We sometimes hear that reflections upon the work should be reserved
for the return to the laboratory or study. This advice seems to be
based upon the assumption that study in the field is not particularly
stimulating and suggestive. On the other hand deliberating
interpretatively in the midst of the problems under consideration is
one of the most favorable conditions possible for the improvement of
the quality and quantity of one’s work. It should be recalled in this
connection that Darwin and Wallace’s evolutionary theory did not
_originate_ in the laboratory, but while in the field in the midst of
their studies, while working reflectively upon their observations and
collections, as Brooks indicates in the quotation at the beginning of
this chapter. The classic case of Bates discovering mimicry in his
London study instead of in the forests of Brazil is to some minds not
an argument for laboratory study, but one for field study. There are
but few subjects which have suffered more from the preponderating
influence of the laboratory.

To be sure, it may require more time to study in the field than if one
collects specimens only, but it is economical in the long run. There
are, of course, certain phases of more indirect observation which can
be done best in the study or laboratory, but at present, field study,
as contrasted with collecting, is a phase of effort urgently needing
emphasis.

The processes of observation and field study and note taking are so
intimately related that taking notes becomes one of the essential parts
of careful observation. This is also one of the most difficult habits
to acquire. The beginner is inclined to write them up, especially field
notes, in the evening after his return from the field. Such notes
are generally brief, lack details, and are usually of little value.
Therefore the safest course to pursue is to describe fully whatever
seems of value, then to go over these facts again and by further
observations increase the number of items noted several times. These
observations should be recorded _as soon as made_, for generally the
lack of notes means a lack of detailed observation. Some observations
can be made only at long intervals, even of many years, others only
with the return of another cycle of behavior, or of another season, and
still others cannot be repeated. It is such considerations as these
which emphasize the need of pursuing the safest course and recording
_instantly_ and fully all observations when made. An excess of notes
is of very rare occurrence. In the effort to write carefully worded
notes one has a very important check upon the tendency toward hasty
observation, because such a description requires one to think over
the observation before it can be expressed. This deliberation is thus
made at the time when reobservation can be made to the best advantage,
and calls attention to the weak points to which special consideration
may perhaps be given a moment later, and thus affords a chance to
complete the observation. Comstock (Insect Life, 1897, p. 323) has well
summed up the taking of notes as follows: “Fill your notebook with
descriptions, but digest them carefully, sifting out for publication
only those that exhaustive study and repeated observation prove to be
valuable. In making observations _be sure_ you are right and then look
again.” And again as Van Hise (Science, N. S., Vol. XVI, p. 326) has
said, “The difference between _bad_ observation and _good_ observation
is that the former is _erroneous_; the latter is _incomplete_.”

Notes are generally taken in one of two forms, in a book or on loose
slips of paper or cards (Hopkins, 1893; Sanderson, 1904). It seems to
be very generally agreed that if a book is used it should be of small
size, of about 4 × 6 inches, so that it may be conveniently carried in
the pocket. For a permanent record such books are a great convenience
when once indexed. But when using such notes, while preparing a report,
they are not so convenient as the note slips, unless one limits such a
report to the form of a narrative. About ten years ago the writer began
using a form of notebook in which an aluminum cover held the loose note
slips. Thus while in the field one has the advantage of a book with a
firm writing surface, and also that of the loose-leaf plan. This form
of cover is now used by a number of field naturalists. The disadvantage
of the slips not being bound might be remedied in part by using some
form of punched slips which are convenient for binding.

Each one must decide for himself which form of recording notes answers
his needs most satisfactorily. There are advantages in uniformity, but
with the variable nature of work, it is sometimes very convenient to
use both methods of recording.

Some students have no method of recording their observations or
reflections upon their lines of interest. This seems to be unwise and
suggests a method of business without bookkeeping. The efficiency of
some students is greater than that of others, not so much because they
possess superior mental ability, but because they have superior methods
of preserving whatever useful ideas occur to them, while the others,
from their lack of records, have no cumulative store upon which to
draw. This is an important form of capital. Note keeping is readily
seen to consist not only of observations, but also of suggestions,
inferences, conclusions, and reflections of any kind which will
facilitate methods of work and the interpretation of the facts.

In describing environments, it is desirable to use the same general
method for different localities so that the descriptions may be
comparable and show some degree of standardization. This method has
been found very useful in taxonomic studies and has similar advantages
here. A brief general statement of the most conspicuous features may
precede, and be followed by detailed descriptions. The order may
well vary with individual workers, but a uniform method is desirable
throughout any single piece of work and has obvious advantages. Thus
one practical plan applied to a forest habitat is, to describe the
substratum, the soil, rock, etc., then the forest litter of organic
débris, then the boles of the trees and the forest crown and its
character, and finally the operation of those agencies which are
causing changes in the forest and which will perpetuate or change it in
the future. No practical forester would be content to shut his eyes to
the future crop of wood, and in the study of animal habitats we must
not be content to rest below such a commercial standard. To some this
seems very theoretical, and yet a farmer who counts upon a crop in five
months, or a forester, in fifty years, is not so branded, and the
ecologist need have no fear in using such practical methods. In other
words, we should consider the future stages of the developing habitat
and learn to perceive the evidences which show in which direction
development or change is taking place; or to determine the “orderly
sequence of external nature.” Not only should the future be considered,
but we should strive also to read the record backward and interpret the
past in terms of processes now in operation. In this respect the point
of view of the geologist who interprets the past in terms of present
processes may well merit our attention. To understand our habitats
they must be studied not only in their length and breadth, but also in
depth--past and future--as they have all three dimensions.

The preceding remarks bear equally well upon observations of
the activities of animals in nature, on account of the absence
of controlled conditions, for these methods have almost as much
significance as the study of the environments themselves; and equally
careful observations and descriptions are essential, if the detailed
processes of animal activities and their transformations are to be
recorded.

An experienced naturalist finds that from year to year the amount of
notes which he takes increases rapidly, and in a very direct ratio to
the progress which he makes in his study. Good note taking is not a
passive process, but one which calls for an alert mind. The prolonged
interest which is necessary to secure detailed observations implies
such a frame of mind. Every one soon tires of any subject unless new
features are constantly being discovered.

In the description of the associations in any given habitat, the
problem is much simplified if one has a clear idea of dominance, knows
how to recognize it, and understands some of its main implications.
The dominant forms are the most common and powerful individuals in
the association. They may or may not be the most conspicuous, from a
superficial view. Conspicuousness may depend upon size, but dominance
refers to large absolute numbers and to influence exerted. We may
profitably compare an association of animals in a given habitat to
a play upon the stage. The environment corresponds to the stage.
The dominant members of the association correspond to the leading
characters, the secondary species, always present, to the essential but
subordinate characters. The individual animals adjust themselves to
one another, especially to the dominant forms, and to the environment,
as the personalities in the play adjust themselves to the dominant
characters, to one another, and to the environment. In both groups some
individuals are dominant, some used and useful, some are tolerated,
others pick up the crumbs, still others are predatory or parasitic, and
all must be mutually adjusted to one another and to the environment.

The number of dominant species within an association is relatively
limited, a fact which holds for both plants and animals. A knowledge
of perhaps 200 or 300 species of animals (and 150 plants) will enable
one to work advantageously in many localities (as in the state of
Illinois). Of this number perhaps not more than about one half or one
third can be considered dominant. Every one who has tried to make
extensive local lists of species knows that it requires many years of
collecting to secure a large number of species. These rare species are
generally of quite minor importance ecologically. Considerations of
this character should be encouraging to those who may be intimidated
by the idea of large numbers of species. Then, of course, it should be
remembered that there are many aspects of ecological work which do not
meet with this variety of animals.




    IV. THE COLLECTION, PRESERVATION AND DETERMINATION OF SPECIMENS


Ecological study does not end with collecting specimens, and it may not
begin there. The importance of collecting and preserving specimens will
vary with the phase of ecological study considered. In the field study
of behavior of a single species there may be almost no collecting of
animals but much collecting of notes; but if one is devoted primarily
to the recognition and study of the composition of associations and
their interrelations, much collecting will have to be done. Also,
when studying the ecological relations of some taxonomic unit, as
in aggregate ecology, the number of associates is so large that one
must do rather extensive collecting. But even the exhaustive study
of the behavior of any single species will necessitate considerable
collecting. The necessity for this has been shown by Forbes (1880, The
Food of Fishes, p. 20) as follows: “If one wishes to become acquainted
with the black bass, for example, he will learn but little if he limits
himself to that species. He must evidently study also the species
upon which it depends for its existence, and the various conditions
upon which _these_ depend. He must likewise study the species with
which it comes in competition, and the entire system of conditions
affecting their prosperity. Leaving out any of these, he is like one
who undertakes to make out the construction of a watch, but overlooks
one wheel; and by the time he has studied all these sufficiently, he
will find that he has run through the whole complicated mechanism of
the aquatic life of the locality, both animal and vegetable, of which
his species forms but a single element.”

Collecting is an important means of ecological study. This is
particularly true in the early stages of such study, but as the student
becomes familiar with species and comes to know many of them at
sight, less collecting will be necessary, except in the case of very
small species and in those studies which depend upon the total catch
as a means of securing data, as, for example, the case of plankton
organisms. On account of the large number of species, very few students
will be able to determine them at sight, but this does not disqualify
a student for beginning ecological study. The greatest aid in handling
such a varied population is a numbering of the individuals, or lots
of specimens, consecutively and recording the full data for them in
the notebook. The question arises at once as to how many specimens are
to be assigned to _one_ number. No rigid rule can be followed, but in
general it is safe to assign a single number to all specimens which
agree in _all the fundamental data_, as date, place of capture, and
exact habitat. And for my own part I number all individuals taken,
upon which any special observations are made, as when a Phymatid is
taken with a dying or dead honeybee, or a dragon fly is taken from the
web of an _Argiope_. In this way the confusion which is particularly
liable to creep into one’s work, where he deals with a large number of
species, and before familiarity with them is acquired, may be reduced
to the minimum. For small animals I have found useful a very liberal
use of vials, into which field numbers, corresponding to numbers in the
field notes, are placed _immediately upon capture_ of the specimens,
and not minutes or hours later when the vials have become mixed, and
recollection is less sharp. Specimens which have been thoroughly
numbered may thus be sent to specialists for determination. This method
uses up many numbers, but, fortunately, the supply is unlimited, and
it gives greater precision to one’s notes, and encourages detailed
observations on individual animals.

In the eyes of many the determination of specimens is such a formidable
task that they are at once repelled from any subject which involves
numerous species. But as we have previously remarked, there are phases
of ecological study which involve only a minimum amount of such work.
On the other hand, one may readily have an undue fear of numerous
species, but no one can doubt that the smaller number of species
found upon mountains or in the far north gives to a beginner certain
advantages for study. But if one’s studies are confined to the more
restricted habitats, the number of species involved is comparable to
the more favored localities mentioned.

An accurately determined series of specimens, conveniently arranged,
will be an important aid in one’s studies. Two forms of arrangement
of such determined series are very helpful; one being synoptic or
systematically arranged, and the other ecologically, by associations
or by a topical arrangement in harmony with the subjects being
investigated. With the use of such series and proper caution, aided by
the best keys in the literature, one may hope to make many of his own
determinations and thus economize his time.

There are many ways to secure the initial series of determined
specimens, and some of these are the following: Our governmental
departments, both national and state, and many of our large museums,
universities, and academies, have numerous experts who are quite
willing and even eager to aid earnest students who wish to have
specimens determined. Then, in addition, there are many expert amateurs
who are equally liberal, so that when all the sources of aid are
considered, the list becomes a surprisingly long one. This is the
fact that should be called to mind when considering large numbers of
species. A student therefore does not need to work alone, but may have
the coöperation of a large number of able and willing collaborators.
Naturally we turn for aid to our United States National Museum as one
of the first sources of assistance, to the Smithsonian Institution,
and to the various scientific departments of the U. S. Department of
Agriculture, particularly to the Bureaus of Plant Industry, Biological
Survey, and Entomology. These sources alone are able to determine
almost any reasonable series of specimens, particularly if they are
well preserved. Arrangements for such determinations can probably be
made by addressing the proper authorities.

The museums of our larger cities, as the American Museum of Natural
History of New York, the Carnegie Museum at Pittsburgh, the Field
Museum of Chicago, and many smaller state and local museums are able
to give very efficient aid in this line. Other local institutions are
the State Universities and Experiment Stations, and the local natural
history surveys, which often exist under the guise of a geological or
agricultural organization. Frequently they are qualified and willing to
do this work.

In very difficult cases it may be necessary to have recourse to
Cassell’s Naturalist’s Universal Directory (Boston, 1905), in order to
find the address of some specialist in a foreign land, who can help,
but generally Americans are the best informed upon their own fauna.

Supplementary to, and in some cases a necessary substitute for,
a reference series of authentically determined specimens, is one
which the student is able to name for himself, by the study of the
literature. Without some special training this may become dangerous
ground to tread upon, but every now and then some young student begins
in this way and develops such care in determining his own collections,
that the method cannot be wholly condemned. Such work in itself has
fascinations, and one may easily occupy all one’s time with it. From
the ecological standpoint to stop with determinations only would be
like acquiring a certain vocabulary, and stopping before learning how
to use the language. Ecological work aims to use the names of species
as the most concise method of referring to kinds of animals whose
interrelations are to be described and interpreted. Taxonomy is the
tool.

There is such an abundance of literature on the technique of collecting
and preserving specimens, and so much of it can easily be secured
by any earnest student, that space will not be taken to discuss
these subjects in detail. Reference will simply be made to the main
convenient sources of information. It should perhaps be mentioned
that very few of these papers have been especially prepared from the
standpoint of the animal ecologist. The student must select and devise
his methods from all available sources.

I have included in this list a few references on the subject of
camping, photography, and the use of instruments needed in the
determination of the physical features of the environment. A few
miscellaneous papers which are suggestive on methods of technique are
also added.

This contains, in addition to its suggestions on collecting, an
interesting outline or classification of animal habitats (Cf. also
Enderlein, 1908, pp. 72-77). This is not a genetic classification.
Dahl’s list of habitats will prove very suggestive to the student who
wishes to develop the genetic system of classification. Ultimately we
must, of course, develop the latter system.

In concluding this list of references I would suggest to the student
the desirability of securing the following catalogues or lists of
publications. A glance at the lists in this volume will show that a
surprisingly large number of the papers or works are governmental
publications, many of which have long been out of print, but many
may still be secured from the different departments or from the
Superintendent of Documents at Washington, D.C.

1. U. S. Geological Survey. List of Publications, including maps.
Washington, D.C.

2. Superintendent of Documents. Lists of publications of the U. S.
Department of Agriculture. Washington, D.C.

3. Smithsonian Institution. List of publications. Washington, D.C.

4. U. S. National Museum. List of publications. Washington, D.C.

5. U. S. Bureau of Fisheries (formerly U. S. Fish Commission). List of
publications. Washington, D.C.

6. For list of dealers in second-hand books see Banks’ Bull. 81, U.
S. National Museum, pp. 117-118. This is one of the best methods of
securing many publications which are out of print.


_3. The Preparation of Papers for Publication and on Proof Reading_

The preparation of papers for publication is a practical phase of study
and an art, or form of technique, about which the zoölogical student is
liable to hear but little. There may be a great economy of effort, and
much time saved, if early in his work the student realizes the need of
cultivating the _habit_ of preparing all manuscripts in a form suitable
for publication. While there is much variation in details, yet within
certain limits there is a certain amount of standardization which
should become _habitual_. Departures from such a standard necessitate
much loss of time which must be devoted to revisions and corrections.
One may work for years and fail to realize this fact, until he attempts
to adjust his habits of writing to the requirements of the editors of
scientific publications. The following references are intended to cover
the main aspects of the preparation of manuscripts and the reading of
proof.

LEWES, GEORGE HENRY (Edited by F. N. Scott).

1891. The Principles of Success in Literature, pp. 163. Boston. Allyn
and Bacon.

the need of simplicity in the language of science, and on the value of
standardization.

The four preceding papers are in many respects models of presentation.
They exemplify the process method applied to _regions_, a phase of
much importance in certain ecologic studies, particularly ecological
surveys. The last two papers are rather detailed applications of the
same ideas. A very profitable study may be made of the method of
presentation in these papers.

 VI. IMPORTANT SOURCES OF INFORMATION ON THE LIFE HISTORIES OF INSECTS
                       AND ALLIED INVERTEBRATES


Insects are to-day one of the dominant forms of life and are present
in almost every large animal association or habitat. They therefore
form an important element in a large number of ecological studies. And
although facts of ecological significance have been accumulating for
many years they are so widely scattered that to find them when needed
is quite a serious problem. To aid in such a search the following
references are given. It should be remembered that spiders, mites,
and myriapods are commonly included in entomological literature and
are therefore included in this list. The list is not intended as a
substitute for the more elaborate sources such as the Zoölogical Record
and similar standard works to be found in large libraries, but it
includes publications that are more likely to be within the grasp of
teachers and students not located at library centers. Many of these are
public documents, and even if out of print, can easily be secured from
second-hand dealers.

A student who has access to large libraries will find the following
paper very valuable in suggestions as to the methods of finding the
literature on many general zoölogical subjects.

  VII. THE LAWS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE, OR THE “ORDERLY SEQUENCE OF
                           EXTERNAL NATURE”

         THE DYNAMIC AND PROCESS RELATIONS OF THE ENVIRONMENT

“Of all the truths relating to phenomena, the most valuable to us are
those which relate to the order of succession. On a knowledge of these
is founded every reasonable anticipation of future facts, and whatever
power we possess of influencing those facts to our advantage.”--JOHN
STUART MILL.

“To study life we must consider three things: first, the orderly
sequence of external nature; second, the living organism and the
changes which take place in it; and, third, the continuous adjustment
between the two sets of phenomena which constitutes life.”--W. K.
BROOKS.

“The truth, indeed, is, that in physical inquiries, the work of theory
and observation must go hand in hand, and ought to be carried on at
the same time, more especially if the matter is very complicated, for
there the clue of theory is necessary to direct the observer. Though
a man may begin to observe without any hypothesis, he cannot continue
long without seeing some general conclusion arise; and to this nascent
theory it is his business to attend, because, by seeking either
to verify or to disprove it, he is led to new experiments, or new
observations. He is led also to the very experiments and observations
that are of the greatest importance, namely to those _instantiæ
crucis_, which are the criteria that naturally present themselves for
the trial of every hypothesis. He is conducted to the places where
the transitions of nature are most perceptible, and where the absence
of former, or the presence of new circumstances, excludes the action
of imaginary causes. By this correction of his first opinion, a new
approximation is made to the truth; and by the repetition of the same
process, certainty is finally obtained. Thus theory and observation
mutually assist one another; and the spirit of system, against which
there are so many and such just complaints, appears, nevertheless, as
the animating principle of inductive investigation. The business of
sound philosophy is not to extinguish this spirit, but to restrain and
direct its efforts.”

--J. PLAYFAIR, “Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the Earth,”
Edinburgh, 1802, pp. 524-525.


The facts and ideas with which the animal ecologist needs to become
acquainted are so widely scattered that a large amount of selective
reading is necessary. The ecologist must read, select, and become
an organizing center of things ecological. All of the facts and
conceptions which he needs are not even confined to zoölogical or
biological literature. In seeking an understanding of any problem,
conventional groupings of the sciences and their arbitrary boundaries
must not bar one from fertile fields. Many of the conceptions of the
physical sciences, due to their more advanced stage of development,
anticipate the future development of biology. This is particularly
true of their dynamic conceptions. For this reason we should not
hesitate to utilize and deliberately strive to secure development
along similar lines in animal ecology. Elsewhere I have stated (An
Ecological Survey in Northern Michigan, 1906, pp. 11, 12) that:
“It is thus very apparent that as soon as ecological phenomena
are investigated dynamically and expressed in terms of processes,
this science will of necessity become more closely correlated with
those allied sciences which have already availed themselves of such
methods.... It seems a very simple matter to give assent to the idea
of the law of change, yet in its practical application this simplicity
often vanishes at once when it is seen that it involves the relation
of cause and effect.... As this method of thinking is not generally
understood, it is occasionally applied in such a crude and general
sense that its bearing cannot be grasped when applied to special
or concrete problems. There can be no question as to the general
validity of this method, but what is now needed is to know how these
processes are combined and related to produce particular environmental
conditions or situations. That these difficulties are not confined
to the ecologist alone, but are obstacles which arise in any attempt
at scientific interpretation, is worthy of special notice. We are
thus able to see why certain naturalists, apparently not recognizing
or understanding the developmental processes which scientific ideas
undergo, nor being acquainted with the tendencies of interpretation,
dynamically considered, now making such rapid headway in ecological
botany, geography, physiography, geology, and psychology, are inclined
to look upon such attempts in biology as merely a fad or personal
peculiarity of the student, and not of any particular consequence. Such
ideas confuse the incidental with the essential and suggest a complete
failure to grasp the situation or to realize the fundamental importance
of stating explanations in terms of processes. Furthermore, in several
of the allied sciences, the methods of dynamical interpretation have
already made considerable advance. Here, then, is a resource, at
present largely unworked by many biologists, where a wealth of ideas
and explanations lies strewn over the surface and only need to be
picked up in order to be utilized by those acquainted with this method
of interpretation.... If the signs of the times are now read correctly,
the most striking advance in scientific methods of thinking during the
present century will be in the direction of interpretation from the
standpoint of processes--dynamically.”

For these reasons I have begun the list of literature with certain
references which deal with the dynamic relations of the environment.
These publications are particularly valuable not only for this method
of treatment, but also for their content. These papers clearly
emphasize the “orderly sequence of external nature,” a conception which
must be grasped much more than superficially, if one is to interpret
the development or evolution of environments. Although this is an
essential part of our problem, as has been so well expressed by Brooks,
yet this phase is probably one of the least understood by zoölogists.
And as long as zoölogical students lack the proper training this
condition will continue. To neglect this aspect in the training of an
ecologist is like neglect of chemical training in a physiologist or
of a physiological training in a psychologist. For one who is ignorant
of the principles of “orderly sequence,” or successions of changes
occurring in the physical, vegetational, and animal environments, it is
manifestly impossible to realize their development; and the application
of such principles to the interpretation of practical problems is
utterly beyond his grasp. We are thus able to see that although the
phrase “orderly sequence of external nature” is fundamentally a simple
conception, it is not grasped without effort, training, and careful
investigation.

Obviously it is impossible to arrange the series of references with
perfect satisfaction. The arrangement which will serve one purpose
will not another, and for this reason it has been necessary to arrange
the lists in more than one order. Certain general references, or some
intended to facilitate the acquirement of the general _point of view_,
are given first, and others are arranged alphabetically. For example,
the papers listed on the processes of change in the physical and
vegetational environment are approximately in an order in which they
may profitably be studied to make the view as concrete as possible. It
is primarily not the abstract idea of the principle of change, which is
relatively easy to grasp, but to be able to apply it to any condition
or location and to make it a guiding principle is very difficult. And
judging from my own observation upon others and my own experience
this method is very rarely mastered, if at all, unless it is actually
worked out in some concrete case, and later expanded to its logical
consequences.

Only a few references are given on general physiology, metabolism, and
allied subjects, but those given furnish a valuable index to further
literature. Only the most arbitrary line can be drawn between papers
dealing with habits, behavior, and individual ecology, and for this
reason most of the references selected are arranged alphabetically.

Particular attention should be called to the fact that it is not to be
assumed that the various authors strive to make the points to which
attention is here called; they may or may not do so. My aim is to call
attention to the _utility_ of the publications from the _standpoint_
advocated throughout the book.

From this point onward in this book the references form its main
feature. For this reason it is important that one should not get an
exaggerated idea of the value of the literature. It is perhaps true
that a large part of the best ecological work has been done with little
knowledge of other ecological writings. This was of course particularly
true of the early workers, and the best work of to-day does not come
from the largest library centers. A student looking over these lists,
and finding that he has access to relatively few papers, may conclude
that all effort is of no avail. The greatest need is not all or even a
majority of the publications on the _general field_, but the relatively
limited number which bear directly upon the problem at hand and enough
of the general papers to aid him in a general orientation. It may be
of some comfort to the isolated student, with his small shelf of books,
to realize that there are perhaps not a half-dozen libraries in America
which contain _all_ the references given in this book. The nearer one
reaches the boundaries of our knowledge, the smaller the amount, and
often the smaller the value of the literature, and the greater the
value of a proper orientation, which comes only with a grasp of general
principles.

“Seeing, then, that in all cases we may consider the external phenomena
as simply in relation, and the internal phenomena also as simply in
relation; the broadest and most complete definition of Life will
be--The continuous adjustment of internal relations to external
relations.”--HERBERT SPENCER.

“It is of the utmost importance, if we are to understand the behavior
of organisms, that we think of them as dynamic--as processes, rather
than as structures. The animal is something happening.”--H. S. JENNINGS
(1907).


Not only is the environment subject to an orderly sequence of changes,
but this same law applies with equal thoroughness to the living animal
itself. The animal is an agent which transforms, in “an orderly
sequence,” by its processes of metabolism, both energy and substance,
resulting in growth, differentiation, multiplication, and behavior.
These activities take place in an orderly manner and are dependent
upon both energy and substance derived from the environment. For these
reasons the processes or changes in metabolism, growth, development,
and behavior, _in so far as they are responses to the orderly sequence
of environmental changes, are ecological problems_. The changes in
behavior during the life of the animal or the development of its
behavior give one of the main clues to the physiological conditions
which determine some of the most characteristic forms of responses, and
finally as a result of all these activities and processes of adjustment
to the conditions of life, a relatively mature and adjusted condition
of the struggle for existence in animals and associations may be
reached, the culmination of animal harmonies. For this reason studies
in modifications of behavior are of fundamental ecological importance,
because they consider behavior not only as ready-made, but also in
the process of making. Such considerations as these make it desirable
to include some of the most valuable and suggestive books and papers
which deal with those general physiological processes influencing
growth, development, multiplication, and behavior, and _particularly
those which aid one in realizing their order or successive changes, or
“orderly sequence.”_

In studying the activities of the individual animal, the normal
environment to which it is _attuned_ forms the natural unit or basis
for study. All processes which modify or change such an optimum will
stimulate the animal, cause responses and adjustments. There are many
degrees or stages in the development of these optima which change
with the functional rhythms and with the development of the animal.
There are those conditions which influence the activity of certain
functions or organs; those which influence the general vital processes
in general, the vital optimum; those which appear to condition the
best development of certain families, genera, etc.; and finally those
of animal associations. Of course these grade imperceptibly into one
another, and a single animal may in its development, traverse all of
these stages in the development of its associational optimum. Optima
thus have histories, and their development and laws of transformation
are of the most fundamental ecological importance (Adams, 1904, 1909;
Blackman, 1905, 1906; Shelford, 1911, 1912).

In the selection of these papers I have been guided by several
considerations. Studies of common animals are given preference, also
those papers which by their method of treatment and point of view
are especially suggestive and may act as models for further study,
and particularly those papers which treat of the activities from the
standpoint of their changes, cycles, modifiability, and development.
It is to such papers that we must look for suggestions regarding
the methods or processes of adjustment between the animal and the
environment. All of these papers are not equally ecological, but all
will be of much utility in ecological work.

The activity of the nervous system is viewed as a _regulatory process_.

The similar responses to diverse stimuli or the similar results
produced by diverse causes are the conditions which make an analysis
and the isolation of causes necessary. With departures from the normal
and optimum into zones of stimulation and of unfavorable conditions
many similar effects or results are produced. The similar results of
extremes of high and low temperature as shown in Fischer’s experiments
on Lepidoptera, and the effects of high temperatures, aridity, and the
lack of oxygen may be cited as examples. Such effects have an important
bearing upon the subject of physical and chemical _limiting factors_
which influence individuals, aggregations, and associations.

genetic is the application of processes to explain origins. The

_3. Animal Behavior as a Process_

“The actual method of work is to first watch the organism under its
natural environment, until one finds out all things it does. Then the
environment is changed a little, to see what difference this makes in
the behavior. We thus try all sorts of different ways of getting the
animal to change its behavior,--including the application of definite
chemical and physical reagents of most varied character.... We thus try
to find the organism’s system of behavior and the things that influence
it,--becoming acquainted with the creature as we might get acquainted
with a person with whom we are thrown much in contact.”--H. S. JENNINGS
(1910).

“My object being the study of the correlative instincts of the young
and adult in relation to all that could be learned about them in a
natural environment, I have followed my usual custom of going out to
the birds, instead of taking them into the laboratory. The facts which
the laboratory can be made to yield are invaluable, but they belong to
a different class from those for which we are now mainly in search,
behavior under the usual or normal conditions.”--F. H. HERRICK (1910).

“As will be seen, these studies include both field and laboratory work,
especially of the American species, and I have made the field work
emphatic wherever at all practicable. I have elsewhere (1909, p. 157)
[Jour. Exp. Zoöl., Vol. VII] emphasized the crying need for larger
attention to this phase of experimental work, believing that in many
cases it is all but impossible to secure trustworthy results as to
behavior of animals where the work has been done under such unusual,
unnatural and artificial conditions as most laboratory provisions
afford. What right has one to assume that the actions of an animal
taken rudely from its natural habitat and as rudely imprisoned in some
improvised cage are in any scientific sense an expression of its normal
behavior, either physical or psychical? Is it within the range of the
calculus of probability that conclusions drawn from observations made
upon an animal in the shallow confines of a finger-bowl, but whose
habitat has been the open sea, are wholly trustworthy? It is no part
of my purpose to discredit the laboratory or laboratory appliances as
related to such investigations. They are indispensable. But at the
same time let it be recognized that they are at best but artificial
make-shifts whose values, unless checked up by constant appeal to
nature, must be taken at something of discount.... It seems to the
writer that until one has been able to place his specimens under
conditions approximating the natural, or has at least brought them
to a state of semi-domestication, where in food-taking, evidence of
health, etc., they are at ease, he has small right to dogmatize as to
conclusions, or presume to make such conclusions the basis of so-called
laws of behavior. Not a little of recent investigation along the lines
of behavior has been vitiated at just this point, and must be repeated
to be made trustworthy. The amazing mass of contradictory results which
has loaded the literature of recent years is attributable to some
extent to this misfortune.”--C. W. HARGITT (1912).

“We are apt to contrast the extremes of instinct and intelligence,
to emphasize the blindness and inflexibility of the one and the
consciousness and freedom of the other. It is like contrasting the
extremes of light and dark and forgetting all the transitional degrees
of twilight.... Instinct is blind; so is the highest human wisdom
blind. The distinction is one of degree. There is no absolute blindness
on the one side, and no absolute wisdom on the other.”--C. O. WHITMAN
(1899).

The precedence here given to _changes in behavior_ is in harmony
with the emphasis which is put upon _processes_ and genetic phases
or sequences throughout this book. As Holmes (1905, p. 108) has well
pointed out, behavior consists of relatively fixed and relatively
changeable responses, with intergradations. There are thus two avenues
of approach which he sums up as follows (p. 112): “In the trial and
error method the random character of the movement impresses us most; in
the tropisms, the element of direct determination by the environment.
Both of these factors run through the behavior of all animals, but they
are mingled in various proportions in different forms. In the lives of
most, if not all animals both are essential elements in the adjustment
of the organism to its conditions of existence.” And in regard to those
responses which do not change in form with experience, he says (p.
106): “The element of spontaneous undirected activity is one of vast if
not essential importance in the life of nearly all animals. The simpler
animals profit by their varied experience, although they may not learn,
and thus secure some of the advantages which it is generally considered
the special function of intelligence to confer.” Thus to the ecologist
studying the sequences of changes in the environment, and changes in
the organism, it is but natural and consistent for him to apply the
same methods to behavior, in order to facilitate their mutual relations
and aid in their interpretation. In a study of the environment we also
have the relatively stable elements and the relatively rapidly changing
ones, and any adequate understanding of animals must correlate these
four variables: two relatively changing, one in the organism and
one in the environment; and two others relatively stable, one in the
organism and the other in the environment.

“Nothing is easier than to admit in words the truth of the universal
struggle for life, or more difficult--at least I have found it so--than
constantly to bear this conclusion in mind. Yet unless it be thoroughly
engrained in the mind, the whole economy of nature, with every fact on
distribution, rarity, abundance, extinction, and variation, will be
dimly seen or quite misunderstood.”--DARWIN.

“Every reflective biologist must know that no living being is
self-sufficient, or would be what it is, or be at all, if it were not
part of the natural world, although no truth is easier to lose sight
of. Living things are real things, ... but their reality is in their
interrelations with the rest of nature, and not in themselves.”--W. K.
BROOKS. (1906.)

_2. The Dynamic Relations of Aggregations and Associations, with
Special Reference to Animal Associations_

“A group or association of animals or plants is like a single organism
in the fact that it brings to bear upon the outer world only the
surplus of forces remaining after all conflicts interior to itself have
been adjusted. Whatever expenditure of energy is necessary to maintain
the existing internal balance amounts to so much power locked up,
and rendered unavailable for external use. In many groups this latent
energy is so considerable and is liable to such fluctuations, that
a knowledge of its amounts and kinds, and of the laws governing its
distribution, is extremely important to one interested in measuring or
foreseeing the sum and character of the outward-tending activities of
the class.”

MÖBIUS, K.

1883. The Oyster and Oyster-Culture. U. S. Comm. of Fish and Fisheries,
Report of Comm. for 1880, Part VIII, pp. 683-751.

On pp. 721-729 the oyster is discussed as a member of a social
community or “biocönosis.” He describes the succession of animals due
to the overfishing of the oyster beds and the invasion of cockles and
edible mussels which close up the available space and prevent the
return of the oyster. One of the earliest papers to recognize clearly a
social community in animals. A very important paper, which also shows
the method of applying the science of ecology.

interrelations of the social community.

WHEELER, W. M.

1911. The Ant-Colony as an Organism. Jour. Morphology, Vol. XXII, pp.

In addition to the insects feeding upon cacti, their enemies or
parasites are listed and also the scavengers, flower visitors, and
incidentally associated species. This is a social community composed
of 324 species of insects, and it forms an excellent foundation for a
study of their interrelations. This is more ecological than is usually
the case in economic reports.

_a. The Relation of Animals to Pollination and to Plant Galls_

The relation of animals to the pollination of plants and to plant galls
is a phase of the _associational relation_ of organisms, but it has
rarely been considered (if at all) from the standpoint of a _biotic
community_. The following list will probably aid one but little in
gaining this general conception, but once the student has it he will
find the list of much assistance. Undoubtedly a relatively new and
fertile field for investigation would be to study the interrelations
of plants and their pollinators as an ecological community, the
association being taken as a unit rather than the individual species of
plants or animals.

         =Genetics.= An Introduction to the Study of Heredity

                        BY HERBERT EUGENE WALTER
            Assistant Professor of Biology, Brown University

               _Cloth, 12mo, $1.50 net; postpaid, $1.63_

In his “Genetics” Professor Walter summarizes the more recent phases of
the study of heredity and gives to the non-technical readers a clear
introduction to questions that are at present agitating the biological
world.

Professor Walter’s conception of sexual reproduction is that it is a
device for doubling the possible variations in the offspring, by the
mingling of two strains of germ plasm. The weight of probability,
he concludes, is decidedly against the time-honored belief in the
inheritance of acquired characters. Professor Walter also predicts
that the key to this whole problem will be furnished by the chemist,
and that the final analysis of the matter of the “heritage carriers”
will be seen to be chemical rather than morphological in nature. In
the practical application of this theory to human conservation or
eugenics, it would follow that the only control that a man has over
the inheritance of his children is in selecting his wife. Professor
Walter holds, if only modifications of the germ plasm can count
in inheritance, and if these modifications come wholly from the
combination of two germ plasms, then the only method of hereditary
influence is in this selection.

“I find that it is a very useful study for an introduction to the
subject. Professor Walter has certainly made one of the clearest
statements of the matters involved that I have seen, and has made a
book which students will find very useful because he keeps everything
in such entirely simple and clear outlines, and at the same time he has
brought the book up to date.”--PROFESSOR LOOMIS of Amherst College.

“I am much pleased with it and congratulate you upon securing so
excellent a treatment. It is one of the most readable scientific books
I have, and goes unerringly to the fundamentals of our most recent
advances in the experimental study of heredity as well as those of the
older studies.”--PROFESSOR GEORGE H. SHULL, Cold Spring Harbor, Long
Island, N. Y.

“There was a decided need for just such a work. The book strikes me
as most excellently done.”--PROFESSOR H. S. JENNINGS, Johns Hopkins
University.

                    The Fitness of the Environment

                       BY LAWRENCE J. HENDERSON
   Assistant Professor of Biological Chemistry in Harvard University

                       _Cloth, 12mo, $1.50 net_


“Darwinian fitness is compounded of a mutual relationship between
the organism and the environment. Of this, fitness of environment is
quite as essential a component as the fitness which arises in the
process of organic evolution; and in fundamental characteristics the
actual environment is the fittest possible abode of life.” Such is
the thesis which this work seeks to establish through discussions of
the physical and chemical characteristics of life and cosmogony, and
through critical study of the properties of matter in their biological
relations.

Water and carbonic acid are shown to be the primary constituents of
the environment. Analysis shows their properties, together with those
of the component elements, hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon, to make up a
series of maxima, among all known compounds and elements, so numerous,
so varied, and so highly favorable, to the organic mechanism that the
fitness of the world for life assumes an importance not less than the
fitness which has been won by adaptation in the course of organic
evolution.

A final chapter discusses the bearing of these conclusions upon
theories of organic evolution, modern vitalism, including the views
of M. Bergson, and the old natural theology, and seeks to harmonize
implications of design with the mechanistic view of nature.

                            COLLEGE ZOÖLOGY

                                  By

                        ROBERT W. HEGNER, Ph.D.

Assistant Professor of Zoölogy in the University of Michigan

         _Illustrated, Cloth, 12mo, xxiv + 733 pp., $2.60 net_


This book is intended to serve as a text for beginning students in
universities and colleges, or for students who have already taken a
course in general biology and wish to gain a more comprehensive view
of the animal kingdom. It differs from many of the college text-books
of zoölogy now on the market in several important respects: (1) the
animals and their organs are not only described, but their functions
are pointed out; (2) the animals described are in most cases native
species; and (3) the relations of the animals to man are emphasized.
Besides serving as a text-book, it is believed that this book will be
of interest to the general reader, since it gives a bird’s-eye view of
the entire animal kingdom as we know it at the present time.

Within the past decade there has been a tendency for teachers of
zoölogy to pay less attention to morphology and more to physiology. As
a prominent morphologist recently said, “Morphology ... is no longer in
favor ... and among a section of the zoölogical world has almost fallen
into disgrace” (Bourne). The study of the form and structure of animals
is, however, of fundamental importance, and is absolutely necessary
before physiological processes can be fully understood; but a course
which is built up on the “old-fashioned morphological lines” is no
longer adequate for the presentation of zoölogical principles.

The present volume has not been made by merely adding a description
of the vertebrates to the author’s “Introduction to Zoölogy” (for a
brief account of which see the last pages of this circular). On the
contrary, it is a new work throughout, although the same general method
of treatment, which proved so successful in the earlier book, has
been employed in this one. Similarly, in the preparation of this book
the author has submitted the manuscript of each chapter to a scholar
and teacher of unquestioned authority in the particular field. The
criticisms and suggestions thus secured have greatly increased both the
accuracy and the practicability of the text.

Only a few animals belonging to the more important phyla, as viewed
from an evolutionary standpoint, are considered. They are, however,
intensively studied in an endeavor to teach the fundamental principles
of Zoölogy in a way that is not possible when a superficial examination
of types from all the phyla is made. Furthermore, morphology is not
specially emphasized, but is coördinated with physiology, ecology, and
behavior, and serves to illustrate by a comparative study the probable
course of evolution. The animals are not treated as inert objects for
dissection, but as living organisms whose activities are of fundamental
importance. No arguments are necessary to justify the “type course,”
developed with the problems of organic evolution in mind, and dealing
with dynamic as well as static phenomena.

“I have read your chapter (The Crayfish and Arthropods in General) and
can express my satisfaction with reference to the general arrangement
of the matter, as well as with reference to the detail. The whole
treatment is up to date, taking account of the modern advancement in
our knowledge of the crayfishes, and, chief of all, the more important
features in the natural history of these animals are very properly
separated from the unimportant ones. I think this chapter gives the
essence of what we know about crayfishes, and any student might use the
book advantageously. In fact, I know no other text-book which gives
such a wealth of information upon so few pages.”--Professor A. E.
ORTHMANN, Carnegie Museum.

“The plan is very satisfactory, and the book will be very instructive
for class use. I am very glad that you have chosen the bee as your
insect type.” (Chapter XII.)--Dr. E. E. PHILLIPS, Department of
Agriculture, Washington, D.C.

The word Household is used as an extension rather than a limitation
of the title. In a thoroughly scientific manner the authors treat the
subject-matter of general as well as of household bacteriology and
include, therefore, the true bacteria as well as the yeasts, molds, and
protozoa. The volume is, therefore, a general textbook of micro-biology
in which special attention is given to those problems which are of
particular interest to the student of household science. The main
divisions of the book treat (1) the micro-organisms themselves, (2)
fermentations with special reference to those affecting foods, (3) the
relations of bacteria and other micro-organisms to health. A fully
illustrated key (comprising 37 pages) to the families and genera of
common molds, supplements the unusually extended discussion of the
morphology and classification of yeasts and molds, and makes possible
the satisfactory identification of all forms ordinarily encountered
by the student. The work embodies the results of the most recent
researches. The book is exceptionally well written, the different
topics are treated consistently and with a good sense of proportion.
While concise in statement, it is thorough in method and scope. It
is, therefore, well adapted for use as a text not only _for students
of household science_, but _also_ for those to whom it is desired to
present the science of bacteriology from _an economic and sanitary
rather than from a strictly medical point of view_.

“The book is a concisely written work on micro-biology, a branch of
economic science that the public is beginning gradually to understand,
has important relationship to the total welfare and prosperity of the
community.... The manual can be recommended as a very good elementary
bacteriology. It comprises about all there is of practical domestic
value.”--_Boston Advertiser._

           PART III--LIFE HISTORY STUDIES ON LIVING PARASITES


With the rapid growth of parasitology there is also a growing demand
for laboratory instruction in this field. The author’s greatest desire
during the time that he has been engaged in teaching this subject
has been to place the work upon a good systematic footing, giving it
proper rank with other phases of applied biology. The exercises in this
volume are based upon two standard courses given at the University
of California during the last four years. These courses are Human
Parasitology (first half-year) and Veterinary Parasitology (second
half-year). Each exercise has had careful testing in the laboratory and
is practical.

The aim of this guide is to give the student a wide, practical view
of the field, so that he may have a fair grasp of the general subject
in its application to the health and well-being of man and beast. The
exercises are in sufficient detail to enable the student to continue
work on some specific group or species if he so chooses.
